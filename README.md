# UART-Hammer ðŸ”¨

A cross-platform Rust CLI to **stress-test and benchmark UART/serial links**.  
Generate frames at line-rate, verify checksums and sequence numbers, and measure throughput, loss, and errors.

---

## Features

- **TX mode** blast frames with configurable payload size and pacing (`max`, fixed gap, or auto-paced by baud).
- **RX mode** receive and validate frames, track sequence gaps, checksum errors, and throughput.
- **Cross-compile ready** runs on x86 hosts and RISC-V SoCs (or any Linux with `/dev/ttyS*`).
- **Stats & logging** per-second stats with optional debug output for each bad/lost frame.
